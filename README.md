DINJA

Dinja is a rails app created at Le Wagon coding bootcamp (https://www.lewagon.com/) in Paris, August 2016. Users can order meals online to cook at home. 'Dinja boxes' containing all the ingredients needed are delivered to your door. Users can customize their food preferences in order to filter the meals suggested each week. This includes selecting only vegetarian or gluten-free meals, for example, as well as the possibility to exclude certain ingredients.
